This project was made in the scope of the information retrieval course of CEID, University of Patras. It has 2 implementations of information retrival models as well as the necessary files for the model to run.

We have a collection of 1199 documents and a collection of 20 queries to test the models with. There are 2 implementations, one of a Boolean Model and a Vector Space Model implementation.

Results for each model and in depth explanation in Greek can be found in the pdf report. The code is open to test.
